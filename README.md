- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Spencer McEntire
  Iâ€™m a Business Data Analytics student at Utah State University with a passion for sports, performance science, and turning data into decisions that matter. I enjoy working on real-world problems where I can use tools like Python, SQL, and Excel to find insights, solve challenges, and create clean, useful visuals.
Right now, I'm building out projects that combine analytics with areas I care aboutâ€”from athlete performance to business strategy. Whether itâ€™s decoding a secret message or analyzing KPIs in a capstone dashboard, Iâ€™m all about making data work for people.

ðŸ’» Tools I Use
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter)
- SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- Excel (MOS Certified)
- Tableau, Power BI
  
 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
-  Performance science analytics projects
- A portfolio of SQL and Excel-based business analysis
- Personal data projects tied to sports + stats
